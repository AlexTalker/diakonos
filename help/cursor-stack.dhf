# The Cursor Stack

The cursor stack is just like the Back and Forward functionality of your web
browser.  Diakonos semi-intelligently keeps track of the places where you do
work.  Using the cursorReturn command (<Ctrl-J>), you can return to previous
work areas.  Use <Ctrl-L> to go forward through the stack.

Here is an example of a common scenario:

1. you are editing in some location
2. you need to examine some other code (such as the definition of a method)
   elsewhere in the file
3. you page through the file, or search for text
4. after examining the code there, possibly copying material to the clipboard,
5. you press <Ctrl-J> and return to the exact location you were working in prior
   to your search
