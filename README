Diakonos
--------

To install, run

./setup.rb

or run

./setup.rb --help

if you want to set options like the installation directories.
The installer only copies two files, diakonos (the executable) and diakonos.conf.
By default, it places them into

PREFIX/bin/diakonos
PREFIX/etc/diakonos.conf

where PREFIX is distro-dependent, but is usually /usr or /usr/local.

----------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to manually install, place the diakonos.conf file in
/usr/local/etc/diakonos/ or ~/.diakonos/.  The diakonos program can be run from
anywhere, such as ~/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/.
