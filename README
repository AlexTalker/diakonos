Diakonos

========


INSTALLATION
============

There are three ways to install Ruby:
  * by rubygems (recommended)
  * from the tarball using setup.rb
  * manual file copy

=== Installing via Rubygems ===

Since version 0.8.3, this is the recommended way of installing Diakonos.
Run the following command as a user with appropriate permissions:

  gem install diakonos

=== Installing from tarball using setup.rb ===

First obtain the diakonos tarball.  This can be found at
http://purepistos.net/diakonos .  Unpack the tarball somewhere.
cd into the unpacked directory.

To install, run

  ruby setup.rb

If you want to set options like the installation directories:

  ruby setup.rb --help

By default, the installer copies bin/diakonos into a system-wide bin directory,
such as /usr/bin; and copies lib/* into the system-wide ruby library path,
such as /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8 .  You may need root priveleges on the
system in order to install to system-wide places like /usr/bin .

=== Installing from tarball by manual copy ===

First obtain the diakonos tarball.  This can be found at
http://purepistos.net/diakonos .

To manually install, copy the contents of the lib directory into some place
where Ruby searches for libraries.  The bin/diakonos program can be run from
anywhere, such as ~/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/.
