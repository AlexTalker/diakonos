- Updated default conf file to include CSS and modifications to "conf" format
and the ruby format.
- Added display debug logging.

0.7.2

- Fixed a drawing bug to do with long lines and screens wider than 80
columns.
- Added support for specifying any numeric keycode as a keystroke.
- Added a suspend command, to suspend the Diakonos process/job to background
and return to the shell.
- Altered drawing code a bit re: the shell and suspend commands.
- Fixed "view.jump.* 0" bug.
- Fixed copy/cut bug for selections starting or ending in columns besides
the left-most column.

0.7.1

- The openFile command now uses /usr/bin/file (if available) to check if the
  file is readable (text), prompting to confirm open if it isn't.
- Fixed popTag bug where popping from an empty stack caused an exception.
- The seek command now no longer (incorrectly) cancels text selection.
- Drawing bugs fixed (to do with illegal off-screen drawing).
- Added the ability to use \n in searches, to match across lines.

0.7.0

- Adjusted buffer management system so that, internally, absolute file paths
  are used.
- Added limited (line-number-based) ctags support.  Commands: goToTag,
  goToTagUnderCursor, popTag.
- Fixed revert command bug.
- Added an evaluate command, which lets you run any Diakonos command.
- Fixed display bug where Diakonos errors (Ruby exceptions) would ruin the
  curses display.
- Malformed regular expressions given for regexp searching are now searched
  for as literal text, instead of just throwing an error.
- Keychains that have no assignment are now shown in full on the interaction
  line.
- Error message for some caught exceptions now includes a listing of probable
  causes.

0.6.13

- Fixed the bug where searching backwards from the start of a line will cause
  the search to start from the end of the line, instead of from the end of the
  next line up.
- Added a "seek" command, which is a sort of silent find.  Used for
  implementing features like go to next word and previous word.
- Adjusted default conf file to include alternate ANSI sequences for function
  keys.
- Context line truncation now omits the more proximate code, not the less
  proximate code.
