Diakonos Changelog
------------------

0.6.13

- Fixed the bug where searching backwards from the start of a line will cause
the search to start from the end of the line, instead of from the end of the
next line up.
- Added a "seek" command, which is a sort of silent find.  Used for
implementing features like go to next word and previous word.
- Adjusted default conf file to include alternate ANSI sequences for function
keys.
- Context line truncation now omits the more proximate code, not the less
proximate code.

0.7.0

- Adjusted buffer management system so that, internally, absolute file paths
are used.
- Added limited (line-number-based) ctags support.  Commands: goToTag,
goToTagUnderCursor, popTag.
- Fixed revert command bug.
- Added an evaluate command, which lets you run any Diakonos command.
- Fixed display bug where Diakonos errors (Ruby exceptions) would ruin the
curses display.
- Malformed regular expressions given for regexp searching are now searched
for as literal text, instead of just throwing an error.
